# Resampling Conclusions

1. Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

   The model that had the best balanced accuracy score is the cluster centroids model.  

2. Which model had the best recall score?

    The models with the best recall score are the SMOTE and Random over sampling models.

3. Which model had the best geometric mean score?

    All models but the simple log regression model have the same geometric mean score.  
    
# Ensemble Conclusions

1. Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

    The easy ensemble classifier has the better balanced accuracy score.

2. Which model had the best recall score?

    The easy ensemble classifier has a better recall score.  Both the high risk and low risk score are higher, while in the random forest only the low risk is higher.  It is a perfect score though with 100%.

3. Which model had the best geometric mean score?

    The easy enseble has the higher geometric mean score as well.  

4. What are the top three features?

    The top three features are total_pymnt, total_rec_prncp, total_pymnt_inv.
